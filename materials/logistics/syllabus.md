## Description

This hands-on course introduces students to prevalent technical tools and skills in the informatics and computer science curriculum. Advanced computer literacy is an essential skill that makes students more prepared, versatile, and productive. During this course, students will gain experience using the command line, version control, package managers, scripting languages, LaTeX, code editors, and more. Students will engage with weekly material during class under the supervision and leadership of upperclassmen. After class, students are expected to complete a small take-home activity to assess their resourcefulness and understanding of the material. After taking this course, students will have a breadth of new skills that will help them succeed in future coursework and industry positions. Intended for undergraduate computer science and informatics majors.
